        ## Hello there, I'm As'ad, a self-taught software developer from
        Indonesia. I started my journey as a Bachelor of Physics, but now I'm in
        love with software engineering. I started coding using Fortran in
        university, but I kickstarted my journey in computer science by taking a
        ReactJS online course. After that, I landed a job in a small software
        house in Jakarta, and have learned a lot about programming since then. I
        mainly do front-end and mobile development, using ReactJS, ReactNative,
        and Flutter; but I am also interested in the backend technology, NodeJS,
        Golang, Rust, etc. Currently, my go-to stack is NextJS/Remix/CRA,
        TailwindCSS, React Query, and Prisma. All done in TypeScript. For me, TS
        is a must. Even my small project uses TS. I take it as an opportunity to
        learn the type system itself.
